### Description

gitGud is a desktop application for storing and managing your friends' gaming information and schedules. It is dedicated to gamers like you and provides a gamer-themed experience with a focus on increasing your efficiency through its typing-based interface.

Previously, keeping track of all of yours friends' gaming information and schedules can be difficult and time-consuming. However, with gitGud, there is no need to get tilted (frustrated) by this anymore as gitGud provides you with a convenient platform to manage essential gaming information of your fellow gamer friends.

For example, to get you excited, gitGud supports many time-saving features such as finding friends available to play with just a single command.
