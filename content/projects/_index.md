<!--

This page represents the landing page for "projects" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "projects". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

In the default theme, "projects" is divided among "Creations" you authored and "contributions" made to others projects.

I have chosen to merge both sections into one "Projects" section.
