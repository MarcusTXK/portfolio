### React With Redux Projects

- Various react projects developed during my journey of learning React and Redux:

---

### Streams

- A simple streaming website that allows a user to stream as well as users to watch streams created by other users.
- When signed in (via Google OAuth 2.0), a user can create a stream. Only the owner of a stream can edit or delete their own stream.
- Users can stream their screen via Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to the created stream.
- Stores data in a [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to emulate backend database.
- Uses [Node Media Server](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server) as a Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server.
