      <title>“Top 8 Teams” Award Winner, Hack&amp;Roll 2022</title>

      <description>Description Hack&amp;amp;Roll is Singapore&amp;rsquo;s largest student-run hackathon, with 532 participants in Hack&amp;amp;Roll 2022. I was inspired to improve NUSMods, a student-run open source project allowing students to plan timetables and modules, as its current module review system was under utilised by students as it was cumbersome and slow to write long reviews.
Solution Leading a team of 4 and in 24 hours, we came up with Ratings, an alternative review system inspired by Glassdoor that aims to encourage more students to provide feedback by streamlining the process as well as allowing prospective students of a module to better understand the module easily.</description>

      <description>Description Hack&amp;amp;Roll is Singapore&amp;rsquo;s largest student-run hackathon, with 473 participants in Hack&amp;amp;Roll 2021. We often come across instances where we have to arrange, with friends, a timing to meetup, be it for a group project or a leisure activity. It is often troublesome to come into an agreement of a common free time slot. Therefore, it is convenient to have Meetups, a planner modification for NUSMods, a student-run open source project allowing students to plan timetables and modules.</description>
