[{"categories":null,"contents":"Description In collaboration with Dyslexic Association of Singapore (DAS), Project Sight Words aims to make learning fun for dyslexic students with an online learning platform that is engaging and customized to their learning needs by using a multi-sensory approach. The platform will have two fronts, a progressive web app to teach students how to read and write through interactive learning, as well as a teacher management portal to help educators manage their lessons and students progress more conveniently.\nWe envision this platform to engage the students’ visual, auditory and tactile senses to help them absorb and learn words. As these students have a learning impairment, our platform will need to be carefully designed to cater to them. The final product will be a deliberate combination of design and engineering to aid DAS’s students in their learning.\nObjective Create a more engaging learning experience for the students Support Dyslexic Association of Singapore’s (DAS) mission by building a new cross platform app that helps DAS educators better teach their dyslexic students Support the teachers in managing classes of dyslexic learners by being able to organize and conduct lessons faster with minimal preparations Context Dyslexic students have trouble associating words and their sounds which makes it difficult for them to process languages. Current teaching methods at DAS are manual and done on paper, which limits the level of engagement and fun for students. Teachers spend a long time preparing for each lesson. Each class size is small, but there are a large number of classes, with a total of over 3100 students. Since DAS educators tailor their lessons according to the student’s ability in their classes, this makes it tedious to prepare for all lessons, as well as making it hard to keep track of and manage them.

Today, DS runs two clinics and two mobile bus clinics that serve to provide care and education dedicated to Diabetes in Singapore.\nProblem Statement DS currently lacks a database and a corresponding database management system. This makes it difficult for DS to harness and analyse the data collected from DS volunteers, members and event participants to improve event management and stakeholder engagement.\nAdditionally, the workflow of DS’ existing mobile bus clinic requires staff to engage in a significant amount of manual tasks. This lowers the organisation’s productivity, incurs costs, and reduces their overall efficiency.\nOur Solution In collaboration with Diabetes Singapore, DSC @ NUS Computing has developed Siew-Dai, a bespoke in-house Data and Workflow Management System that improves Diabetes Singapore’s operational efficiency.\nThe system has a user-friendly interface and various functions, including one that supports Diabetes Singapore with the management, scheduling and deployment of their mobile screening services to partner clinics across Singapore. This function enables the Diabetes Singapore team to automate the complex and manual process of managing mobile bus deployments via a few simple clicks. It also consolidates the organisation’s multiple existing tech solutions in one platform, reducing the administrative workload for their staff.\nWith upcoming stakeholder management capabilities to be incorporated into the system, Siew-Dai will also provide Diabetes Singapore with the capabilities to track, manage and visualise large amounts of volunteer, beneficiary and donor information, thus enabling the organisation to adopt a more tailored approach when it comes to stakeholder engagement.\nProduct Demonstration ","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/projects/project-siew-dai/","tags":["Typescript","React","Redux","NodeJS","Express","Sequelize","PostgreSQL","Netlify","Heroku"],"title":"Google Developer Student Club - Project Siew Dai"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Description gitGud is a desktop application for storing and managing your friends\u0026rsquo; gaming information and schedules.

Ninja Van is a leading courier company in Singapore and across Southeast Asia, with more than 67,000 staff and delivery personnel and handles around 2 million parcels a day across Southeast Asia.\nSolution Ninja Scheduler is the bot designed for busy people who are unavailable to receive their package on the actual delivery day. This bot is targeted at customers who might be unavailable to receive the package on the stipulated delivery date, and might want to reschedule the delivery. It is also designed for users who are willing to pay more to get faster deliveries, but are unable to do so as online retailers often only offer the cheapest (and thus slowest) delivery option.\nTo solve this issue, our bot automates the handling of rescheduling deliveries. Customers can view the delivery dates of their orders, and based on their tier of delivery service for a particular order, they can upgrade to a different tier, to schedule it earlier or later based on their availability. They can even upgrade to the timeslot delivery scheme, which allows them to choose from 4 different timeslots to get their package delivered. If they are unavailable to receive the package during the week of delivery, they can opt for the 14 day standard or timeslot delivery tiers. The bot handles the upgrade by issuing invoices through Telegram, and once paid they can proceed to reschedule according to their tiers! However, each customer is limited to 2 free reschedules. Once they have hit that limit, they can \u0026ldquo;top-up\u0026rdquo; their number of reschedules through the bot.\nBy providing 5 different upgradable delivery tiers (Standard, Express, Timeslot, 14 day Standard, 14 day Timeslot) and easy rescheduling, we are confident customers will have better experience with Ninjavan, tailored to their needs.\n","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/awards/ninja-van-code-dojo-2022/","tags":["Python","Cloud Firestore","Heroku"],"title":"4th Place, Ninja Van Code Dojo Hackathon 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Description Hack\u0026amp;Roll is Singapore\u0026rsquo;s largest student-run hackathon, with 532 participants in Hack\u0026amp;Roll 2022.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026#34;HTML\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JSON\u0026#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
