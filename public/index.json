Ninja Van is a leading courier company in Singapore and across Southeast Asia, with more than 67,000 staff and delivery personnel and handles around 2 million parcels a day across Southeast Asia.\nSolution Ninja Scheduler is the bot designed for busy people who are unavailable to receive their package on the actual delivery day. This bot is targeted at customers who might be unavailable to receive the package on the stipulated delivery date, and might want to reschedule the delivery. It is also designed for users who are willing to pay more to get faster deliveries, but are unable to do so as online retailers often only offer the cheapest (and thus slowest) delivery option.\nTo solve this issue, our bot automates the handling of rescheduling deliveries. Customers can view the delivery dates of their orders, and based on their tier of delivery service for a particular order, they can upgrade to a different tier, to schedule it earlier or later based on their availability. They can even upgrade to the timeslot delivery scheme, which allows them to choose from 4 different timeslots to get their package delivered. If they are unavailable to receive the package during the week of delivery, they can opt for the 14 day standard or timeslot delivery tiers. The bot handles the upgrade by issuing invoices through Telegram, and once paid they can proceed to reschedule according to their tiers! However, each customer is limited to 2 free reschedules. Once they have hit that limit, they can \u0026ldquo;top-up\u0026rdquo; their number of reschedules through the bot.\nBy providing 5 different upgradable delivery tiers (Standard, Express, Timeslot, 14 day Standard, 14 day Timeslot) and easy rescheduling, we are confident customers will have better experience with Ninjavan, tailored to their needs.\n","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/awards/ninja-van-code-dojo-2022/","tags":["Python","Cloud Firestore","Heroku"],"title":"4th Place, Ninja Van Code Dojo Hackathon 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Description Hack\u0026amp;Roll is Singapore\u0026rsquo;s largest student-run hackathon, with 532 participants in Hack\u0026amp;Roll 2022.

This created a quick and easy rating system to encourage students to provide feedback on modules, aiding future students’ module planning efforts by being able to better grasp of the weekly workload, content difficulty and the best lecturers.\nFor our efforts, we were awarded the top prize of \u0026ldquo;Top 8\u0026rdquo;, where the best 8 teams were selected by a panel of judges in no particular order and presented the award.\n","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/awards/hack-n-roll-2022/","tags":["Typescript","React","NodeJS","Express","Firebase"],"title":"“Top 8 Teams” Award Winner, Hack\u0026Roll 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Description Source Academy is an open-source immersive online experiential environment for learning programming, developed in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, currently headed by the Source Academy 2021 leadership team.\nEvery year, freshmen in the School of Computing will take CS1101S, a module that introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing.

It is often troublesome to come into an agreement of a common free time slot. Therefore, it is convenient to have Meetups, a planner modification for NUSMods, a student-run open source project allowing students to plan timetables and modules.\nSolution Meetups is a new tab in NUSMods that features an edit mode, which allows for the editing of your own free time slots, easy importing from your NUSmods timetable, as well as resetting to clear all unavailable slots.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented. If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory. Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so. You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory. Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://marcustxk.com/blog/force-ssl/","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Multiple plugins used by thousands of teams that provide enhanced functionality of Atlassian’s core products (primarily JIRA and Bamboo) to enrich CI/CD capabilities, DevOps automation, or productivity.
