Solution Leading a team of 4 and in 24 hours, we came up with Ratings, an alternative review system inspired by Glassdoor that aims to encourage more students to provide feedback by streamlining the process as well as allowing prospective students of a module to better understand the module easily.</description></item><item><title>1st Place, 18th SoC Term Project Showcase (STePS)</title><link>https://marcustxk.com/awards/18th-steps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcustxk.com/awards/18th-steps/</guid><description>Description Source Academy is an open-source immersive online experiential environment for learning programming, developed in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, currently headed by the Source Academy 2021 leadership team.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://marcustxk.com/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcustxk.com/search/</guid><description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
